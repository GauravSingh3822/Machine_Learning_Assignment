    "Filter Method in Feature Selection is process to select the relavent feature from dataset before apply the machine learning algorithms..Techniques like correlation, chi-square, and information gain are used to score and rank features. The top-ranked features are selected, reducing dimensionality and improving model performance. This method is computationally efficient but may miss feature interactions.  "

Iska ek aur drawback ye hai ki ye features ke beech ki interactions ko consider nahi karta, jisse kuch important feature combinations miss ho sakte hain. Agar dataset noisy ho, to irrelevant features bhi select ho sakte hain, jo model ki accuracy ko negatively impact kar sakte hain. Ye method simple aur fast hai, lekin zyada complex problems ke liye optimal nahi hota."
