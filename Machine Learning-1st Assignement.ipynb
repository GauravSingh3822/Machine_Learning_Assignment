    "## Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, anomaly detection is done by identifying patterns or clusters in the data and flagging data points that don't fit well with those patterns. Since the model doesn't have labeled examples of \"normal\" or \"anomalous\" data, it detects outliers by finding points that deviate significantly from the majority. For example, in network security, unsupervised learning can detect unusual behavior that might indicate a potential threat or attack.\n"
